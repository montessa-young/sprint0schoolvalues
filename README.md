# School Values
Lambda school is much more than a school. It's a community. It's a job placement agency. We're a group of highly-motivated individuals striving to make entry into the tech industry more accessible by providing educational opportunities to underrepresented and underserved individuals.

Our students are at the heart of our mission. Lambda School is pioneering a new model of higher education in which the school invests in the students, instead of the other way around. We find untapped or underutilized talent, and train that talent for the most in-demand jobs in the world.

At the end of this module you should be able to:

* Identify school values.
* Integrate with the school culture and understand the code of conduct expectations.
* Know how to access and participate in school engagement opportunities.
* Begin to develop a connection to project managers, instructors and staff through introductions.
* Introduce yourself and share information that may form connections with other students.
* Know who to ask for help and how to ask for help at Lambda School

## School Mission, Vision and Values
The vision of Lambda School is to unlock everyone’s potential, regardless of circumstance. 
The mission is to be the best place in the world to launch a new career.
The core values are;
1. Student Obsessed
This isn't about helping students get jobs, this is about making them unbeatable in the market, challenging when others around you aren't also being student obsessed, staying awake until your student can sleep.
2. Act Like an Owner
This isn't making sure something is running smoothly. It's about being maniacal about finding ways to continually improve, own mistakes and make your function better than anyone has ever done it. Ever.
3. Organize Chaos
This isn't about making something that lacked organization before less messy, it's sweating over the details to lay the concrete foundation, systems, clear accountability, data-driven results, and cross-functional excellence to make sure there's no mistake something works great over and over again.
4. Nothing Sacred
This isn't about being open to change. It's about not accepting mediocracy anywhere in business. Expect everyone and everything to be world class.
5. Go for It
This isn't about trying, it's about taking risks, going big or going home. Make Elon blush.

These values were written for the leadership, instructors and staff at Lambda School. We are sharing them with you here to show our dedication to meeting our vision and mission. This set of values means that operations at Lambda School will be different from any other school you have attended. Things will change and sometimes they will change often and rapidly. The changes will occur based on data and feedback from students and future employers. The change is to make things better. At a typical school they would wait and make the change in the next cohort or the next school year. At Lambda school if it is a needed change it happens now. Being a future professional in the technology industry, you will need to be comfortable with change. But, we are student obsessed, so if the changes are not serving you, please reach out to your program manager or the student success team and let them know. Your feedback is valuable. 

## Code of Conduct
Lambda School is challenging by design. We move quickly and each day builds upon the previous. To ensure your success, we’ve outlined several guiding principles to follow.

1. Participate - we expect each student to actively participate in the course by attending all lectures, having an online presence during course hours, engaging with instructors and Project Managers, and collaborating with other students.
2. Complete All Coursework - The best way to get better at coding is more coding. We expect students to complete each and every assignment given as part of the course, as the concepts learned in one assignment are a building block needed for future assignments. Even if you know a concept, repetition is key to solidifying the foundation of your knowledge.
3. Ask for Help - If you feel lost or are stuck on an assignment, it’s your responsibility to reach out to your instructors, teaching assistants, or fellow students for help. We can only provide support if let us know. We may not always give you the answer, but we will provide you with the tools to derive the answer on your own.
4. Integrity - Asking for help and researching online is a key part of learning, however, you cannot use code you did not write. Do not shortcut your education by cheating. Ask for clues, not code when seeking help. If you put in the effort, you will reap the reward.
5. Plagiarism - If a student is caught copying code from staff or other students, or submitting work that is not their own; a member of Student Success will evaluate the situation and based on findings, the student may be withdrawn from Lambda School.
6. Respect - We are fortunate Lambda School students and staff have extremely diverse backgrounds. Contribute to creating a positive experience for everyone by being respectful in your communications (sarcasm translates poorly via text and online chat), and keeping politics confined to the #politics channel in Slack. Do your part to make Lambda School a welcoming place to learn by encouraging your fellow classmates, offering support, and listening to others.
7. Professionalism - Lambda School is a professional environment. We expect students to act accordingly. Punctuality, timeliness, accountability, and open communication are crucial, not only for your success here at Lambda School, but also in your careers afterward. The professional expectations we require of our students are the same your future employers will expect of you. A good rule of thumb is: if you wouldn’t do or say a thing in front of an employer or colleagues at your job, don’t do it here at Lambda School. Additionally, professionalism includes protecting internal intellectual property.
8. No Harassment Policy - Lambda School is a place to learn. We aim to create an environment of mutual trust and the absence of intimidation, oppression, and exploitation. Students and staff should be able to work and learn in a safe, yet stimulating atmosphere. As such, Lambda School will not tolerate any form of harassment, verbal or physical conduct, designed to threaten or intimidate others, which includes but is not limited to the following: Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or unwelcome regarding a person’s nationality, origin, race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, sexual identity, marital status, age, body, disability or appearance, including epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping. Nonverbal harassment includes distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles or shows hostility, aversion or disrespect toward an individual or group because of national origin, race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability, sexual identity, marital or other protected status.
9. Communication - You are expected to regularly communicate with your Project Managers regarding daily progress. Failure to remain in contact with Project Managers, Instructors, Student Success, or any other staff, may result in being withdrawn from the program.

Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in deferral or removal from the program. If removed from the program for Code of Conduct reasons, your income share agreement or tuition refund will be prorated as described in the ISA FAQ section of the User Manual.

If you think there is something that is preventing you from being successful, communicate with your instructors and Project Manager.

## Engagement Opportunities
As a student we want you to form a connection with Lambda school, with Lambda school staff and with your fellow students. These connections help provide the social interaction and support you will need to be successful. In Slack, there are channels setup to allow you to reach out to other Lambda students in your physical area, chat about your favorite TV shows and share your favorite hobbies. 
Lambda school is encouraging local meetups of students and is even willing to pitch in some money for food. You can find information about local meetups by joining your state channel in Slack. 
Do you have a beautiful yard and want to share pictures? There is a Slack channel for that #gardens_and_yards. Are you focused on improving your body as you improve your mind? These is a Slack channel for that #fitness or even #biohacking. In a more educational related channel you can share your favorite books in the Slack channel #books. Find a few that interest you to join.
If you want to keep up with Lambda School as a company there is a blog on the main website or there is an active Lambda School Twitter account https://twitter.com/lambdaschool or follow our CEO Austen Allred at https://twitter.com/Austen.
We hope that you'll be a part of the Lambda School community far into the future as an alumni working as a professional in the tech industry.

## Who to ask for help at Lambda School
Who you ask for help depends on what type of question you have. A great starting point for most questions is your project manager. If you have an instructional question posting in your course help channel in Slack would be appropriate. If you have a non-instructional question using the /frontdesk command in Slack to submit a question to student services would get you an answer. 

## How to Ask for Help at Lambda School
Lambda school is focused on your success and all of our processes are geared toward helping you succeed. We are also trying to turn you into a competent professional that has critical thinking skills, knows how to learn, and is great at problem solving. The material you are learning will be difficult and you will struggle. Here is a framework on solving a problem that you can use to create a great question or possibly solve your own problem along the way.

1. Clearly define the problem- In order to solve the problem, you need to be able to describe it succinctly. No handwaving. Vague, overarching problems are not solvable. So before you can even state the problem you may need to gather supporting information. If you can't, that becomes your first problem to solve.

2. What is your desired outcome?- Do you want a link to a useful resource or someone to talk you through the example again? What is going to be the most helpful answer for you? This outcome statement becomes your north star as you brainstorm solutions.

3. Brainstorm potential solutions- Take some time to think about how you might solve this problem. What resources do you have available? 

4. Ask the question- We have a guideline of a 20 minute rule. Work on your problem for 20 minutes by clearly defining it, figuring out the desired outcome and brainstorming solutions. If your problem is not solved in these steps then it is time to reach out for assistance. Instead of a generic "I can't do this, I don't even know where to start" you should have a "In the last section of this piece of code I don't understand this particular part and would like assistance finding this particular resource". This makes your question easier to answer for instructors, project managers and staff. It also shows that you took the time to try to think critically and problem solve before asking. No one wants you to be stuck, frustrated and contemplating quitting. But, we do want you to learn how to learn and be resilient when things get hard.
